# big-bang
In this project we try to simulate the big bang with balls moving in opposite directions at zero gravity.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To simulate the Big Bang, copy and paste to create the three files (bigBang.html, ball.js, and mystyle.css) within a single folder. Open the html file on a browser. Access the console and set "gravity = 0". Enter. Then create the number of balls you wish to make call the function "factory(number of balls)". To see the Big Bang in action, enter "update()" into your console.

<h2>Usage</h2>
Used to simulate the Big Bang.
